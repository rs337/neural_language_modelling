        "\n",
        "**Recurrent Neural Networks** (RNNs) are another type of artificial neural networks designed to process sequential data by maintaining a memory of previous inputs. Unlike feedforward neural networks (Week 2), where information flows only in one direction (from input to output), RNNs have connections that allow information to persist over time and influence the processing of subsequent inputs. This makes RNNs well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, such as speech recognition and handwriting recognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "The success of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in modeling data hinges on their ability to maintain a form of short-term memory which is updated at each time step as new input is processed. Through the simple mechanism of copying the preceding hidden state and concatenating it to current inputs, this memory captures information about past inputs, allowing previous inputs to shape future outputs at each time step. See the lecture slides and references for details.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will code, more or less from scratch, a simple Recurrent Neural Network (sometimes called an Elman Network, see original paper in Week 4 Lab folder) and apply it to a sentiment classification task.\n",

We need to change the weights and biases individually, because the loss is a function of all the weights and biases (i.e. many variables), so we use partial derivatives with respect to each weight and bias. Sed previous lectures for details.\n",

For algorithmic simplicity, we `unroll' the network across time to obtain a single network that can be treated as a FNN for training and inference purposes. When backpropagation works like this it's called Backpropagetion through time (BPTT). See lectures and Jurafsky & Martin, Section 13.1 for details.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Backpropagation through time (BPTT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation_through_time) is a gradient-based technique used to train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In RNNs, while weights and biases are shared across all time steps, it's crucial to track the changes in weights and biases corresponding to the received input at each time step. This tracking is accomplished by unrolling the recurrent connections, as shown in the lecture slides on Slide 13, replicating the weights shared across time steps, and feeding in the inputs received at time t, for each time step t."
