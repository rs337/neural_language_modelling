    "- In chapter 6, it is noted that sigmoid and tanh use can lead to vanishing gradients in hidden layers(high input values lead to \"saturated\" outputs where derivative is close to 0). Therefore, ReLU may be a better option\n",

    "### Class initialisation\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap from the lecture, creating a feedforward neural network and training it involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialise Layers:**\n",
    "   - For each layer, initialise a weight matrix and a bias vector:\n",
    "      - The weight matrix (**W**) size is (input features size, output features size).\n",
    "      - The bias vector (**b**) size is (1, output features size).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Activation Functions for Hidden Layers:**\n",
    "   - Choose activation functions for hidden layers. Common choices include:\n",
    "      - [Sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function)\n",
    "      - [Softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function)\n",
    "      - [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define Forward Propagation Function:**\n",
    "   - Implement a function that computes the output of the neural network given an input by applying activation functions to the weighted sums of inputs at each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Define Loss Function:**\n",
    "   - Choose a loss function that measures the distance between predicted and gold outputs. Common choices include mean squared error for regression tasks and cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Define Backward Propagation Function:**\n",
    "   - Implement a function that computes the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and biases by applying the chain rule of calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Define Training Loop:**\n",
    "   - Iterate through the training data multiple times, performing the following in each iteration:\n",
    "      - Forward pass to compute predictions.\n",
    "      - Compute loss using the chosen loss function.\n",
    "      - Backward pass to compute gradients.\n",
    "      - Update weights and biases using an optimisation algorithm (e.g., gradient descent).\n",
    "      - Repeat until the loss converges or a predefined number of iterations are reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good practice to implement neural network architectures using the class data structure in Python for reusability. This allows training multiple instances with different hyperparameters and facilitates debugging in case of issues. Following this practice, below we implement our feedforward neural network as a class, incorporating the steps above."
