        "# CSC1185 Neural Language Modelling: Week 2 Lab -- Feed Forward Neural Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "**Feedforward Neural Networks** (FFNs) are a type of artificial neural network useful for more complex NLP tasks than logistic regression (LR), including both classification and language modelling tasks. FNNs consist of layers of interconnected neurons organised into an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each connection between nodes is associated with a weight, and each neuron computes the weighted sum of its inputs and applies an activation function to the result which gives the unit's output. See the lecture slides and Jurafsky & Martin, Chapter 6 for details.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will code, more or less from scratch, a Feedforward Neural Network and apply it to a topic classification task.\n",
        "\n",
        "A lot of it should look familiar from the Week 1 lab, as each node and its inputs in an FFN can be thought of as a binary logistic regressor (except that the activation function isn't always the sigmoid).\n",

        "When working with text data, we need to convert the text into numerical features that can be fed into the model. There are many approaches for representing text data as features. In the Week 1 lab, we used features such as the natural logarithm of text length, and the number of sport-related words, etc. Here, we'll leverage TF-IDF as a more informative feature that can help our model to perform better. TF-IDF reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).\n",
        "\n",
        "[TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf), short for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, is a numerical statistical technique used to generate features from texts. Let's break down TF-IDF into two components: Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Term Frequency (TF):**\n",
        "TF measures how frequently a term (word) appears in a document. It's a local measure that focuses on the importance of a word within a specific document. The formula for TF is:\n",

        "$\\text{TF}(t, d) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times term } t \\text{ appears in document } d}{\\text{Total number of terms in document } d}$\n",
        "\n",
        "In other terms, it's the ratio of the number of times a specific word occurs in a document to the total number of words in that document. TF values are higher for words that appear frequently in the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):**\n",
        "IDF measures the importance of a term across the entire corpus. It provides a global measure of the rarity of a term. The formula for IDF is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\text{IDF}(t, D) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\text{Total number of documents in the corpus } N}{\\text{Number of documents containing term } t + 1}\\right)$\n",
        "\n",
        "In other terms, it's the logarithmically scaled inverse fraction of the number of documents containing the term *t* to the total number of documents in the corpus. The addition of 1 in the denominator prevents division by zero when a term does not appear in any document. The logarithmic scaling helps to smooth the values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**TF-IDF:**\n",
