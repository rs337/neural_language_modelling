        "\n",
        "**Feedforward Neural Networks** (FFNs) are a type of artificial neural network useful for more complex NLP tasks than logistic regression (LR), including both classification and language modelling tasks. FNNs consist of layers of interconnected neurons organised into an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each connection between nodes is associated with a weight, and each neuron computes the weighted sum of its inputs and applies an activation function to the result which gives the unit's output. See the lecture slides and Jurafsky & Martin, Chapter 6 for details.\n",

        "In this lab, you will code, more or less from scratch, a Feedforward Neural Network and apply it to a topic classification task.\n",
        "\n",
        "A lot of it should look familiar from the Week 1 lab, as each node and its inputs in an FFN can be thought of as a binary logistic regressor (except that the activation function isn't always the sigmoid).\n",

In the Week 1 lab, we used features such as the natural logarithm of text length, and the number of sport-related words, etc. Here, we'll leverage TF-IDF as a more informative feature that can help our model to perform better. TF-IDF reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).\n",
